In software development, distributed version control (also known as distributed revision control) is a form of version control in which the complete codebase, including its full history, is mirrored on every developer's computer. This enables automatic management branching and merging, speeds up of most operations (except pushing and pulling), improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups.
